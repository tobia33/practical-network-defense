The security policy seems robust, but it has flaws.
Hosts from the internet can only reach the web server and the proxy server, this is good.
If these are compromised by an attacker, the attacker can:
	- send logs to the logserver 
	- send logs to the graylog server
	- reach the internal dns
		these are not really avoidable, and can lead to the compromise of these other hosts if there are vulnerabilities, but should be secure if updated regularly
	- make http/s requests to external web services (proxy only)
		can't lead to the compromise of other acme hosts but can be used for other types of attack
	- reach the graylog web interface
	- reach the greenbone web interface
		these are the ones we don't
